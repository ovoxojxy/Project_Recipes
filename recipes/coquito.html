    <h2>This is coquito</h2>

    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of 
        coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, 
        cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. 
        It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it 
        in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with 
        more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaporated milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Cream of coconut</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>White rum</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>vanilla</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

        <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a 
            double boiler over simmering water. Cook over the simmering 
            water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough 
            to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a temperature of 
            160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, 
            sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, 
            and cloves; blend until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>

        <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the 
            refrigerator; serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
